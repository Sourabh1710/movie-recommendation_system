Title: Movie Recommendation System using Cosine Similarity and Vectorization

Description:
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository! This project leverages cosine similarity and vectorization techniques to offer movie recommendations based on content. With the power of machine learning and the help of scikit-learn (a popular machine learning library in Python), this system enhances your movie-watching experience by suggesting movies similar to those you select.

Key Features:

Cosine Similarity: The system calculates cosine similarity between movie vectors to measure their similarity, enabling accurate recommendations based on user preferences.
Vectorization: Movie data is transformed into numerical vectors using vectorization techniques, allowing for efficient mathematical computations and similarity comparisons.
Scikit-learn: Utilizing scikit-learn's robust tools and algorithms, we build and train the recommendation system to provide reliable and efficient recommendations.
Content-Based Recommendations: Users input a movie name, and the system suggests top 5 movies that align with that particular input movie.
